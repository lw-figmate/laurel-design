This project has access to Laurel Design System, installed via the `@anthropic/laurel-design` npm package. Files in the guidelines directory show how to use Laurel Design.

Always read:
- All files with a name that starts with "overview-"
- All files in the design-tokens folder

Read the files in the guidelines/components directory when you want to use the component with that name. For example, if you want to use Button, read guidelines/components/button.md. Additional context can be found by reading the code for the corresponding component in /node_modules/.

## Component Usage Guidelines - READ THIS FIRST

IMPORTANT: Always prefer to use components from Laurel Design if they exist. For example, prefer to use a Button component from Laurel Design, rather than a regular `<button>` element.

IMPORTANT: Follow these steps IN ORDER before writing any code:

Step 1: Read Overview Files (REQUIRED)
Read ALL files with a name that starts with "overview-" in the guidelines directory:
- overview-setup.md
- overview-components.md
- overview-icons.md
(And any other overview-*.md files)

Step 2: Read Design Tokens (REQUIRED)
Read ALL files in the design-tokens/ folder. Do NOT skip this step.

Step 3: Plan what components you need to use (REQUIRED)

Step 4: Read Component Guidelines BEFORE Using Components (REQUIRED)
BEFORE using ANY component, you MUST read its guidelines file first:
- Using Button? → Read guidelines/components/button.md FIRST
- Using Card? → Read guidelines/components/card.md FIRST
- Using Dialog? → Read guidelines/components/dialog.md FIRST

Step 5: Plan what icons you need to use (REQUIRED)
Before using ANY icon, read overview-icons.md to understand the icon system.

DO NOT write code using a component until you have read its specific guidelines.
